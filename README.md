# AWS ACCOUNT SETUP

The purpose of the Week 1 task is:

To get familiar with AWS by creating and verifying a personal AWS account, which will be used for hands-on cloud projects throughout the bootcamp.

This ensures every participant has access to their own AWS environment to practice and complete future tasks.

## STEPS I TOOK

- I went to [https://aws.amazon.com/free](https://aws.amazon.com/free) to sign up for a Free Tier AWS account.
- I entered my personal email address, selected a root user name, and created a strong password.
- I filled in personal details and contact information.
- I added my debit card details for billing verification (as required).
- I verified my phone number via OTP.
- I selected the **Basic Support (Free)** plan.
- I successfully logged into the **AWS Management Console** to confirm my account was active.



## WHAT I DID
- I created a new AWS account using my personal email address.
- I completed the required steps: email verification, billing information, and phone verification.
- I chose the free support plan to avoid unnecessary charges.
- I logged in to confirm successful setup via the AWS Console showing my account ID.
